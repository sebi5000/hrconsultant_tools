<h1>Welcome to HR Consultant Tools</h1>
<p>
    This is the place, where you can find some tools which might help you doing HR/IT Projects. Why these tools don't stay in the Web? It's because of Data Security.
    I don't want to bring your Data into any kind of database or access them via Internet. This way the Tools can handle Files with sensitive Data without any problem.
    <mark>Nothing will be stored outside your machine!</mark><br />
    The whole Application is Open-Source, so you can check the Quellcode here: <a href="https://github.com/sebi5000/hrconsultant_tools">HR Consultant Repository</a>.
